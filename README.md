The game will start off on the main menu/title screen. 
To begin playing the game, press the Play button.

For this first playtest, there's only one mouse that is controllable.

Move with A and D and jump with space.
To pick up a powerup, run over it and the mice will have the powerup for a limited amount of time.
All enemies will kill the mouse on contact. Some enemies (the spider and the rattrap) have health bars and can be killed with the protein powerup.
Avoid obstacles using powerups to reach the end of the level!

Levels are meant to be difficult to play through as one mistake can lead to restarting the entire level.
